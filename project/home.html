        <h2>Looking forward in fashion: March 2021 </h2>
        <img src="media/pocket.jpg" alt="flower pocket picture" class="pocket">
        <p>
            New month means new fashion trends and fashion moments, so the question now is, what does March 2021 have in store for us.
        </p>

        <p>With the weather warming up, it is about time to shed some layers and show some leg. Mini skirts are back and better than ever ranging from simple pencil skirts to fun and funky pleated skirts that have been all the rage lately. What’s best about this trend is it is super simple to find pieces that go with everything. Some of our favorite brands and websites such as ThredUp, shopcider, Madewell and Zaful  are already starting to release their Spring collection which includes a variety of styles and colors of skirts to help ring in the new season.
        </p>

        <p>If you struggle with the transition of seasons and find yourself needing warm clothes until it actually hits  summer months, then you’re in luck because statement trousers are coming in hot as a new trend. Be expressive but stay warm with different patterns and colors. Pairing these with simple tanks or long sleeves will draw attention to your outfit without you having to sacrifice any warmth. Thrifting these types of pants would actually be a great idea to stay on trend and within budget as you could fit right in with a vintage pair of bell bottoms or some funky trousers you find at your local thrift store.
        </p>

        <p>All in all, one of the best ways to be in on the trends for spring, especially March 2021, is to gather some pieces to add a pop of color. Whether they be shoes, a scarf, a cropped sweater, or full pants, having a reliable collection of pops of color for the springtime will make the transitions of outfits a lot easier and less stressful. Checking all our favorite brands and websites is a great way to search for new trending colors--such as sage green and champagne--that will give you a whole new wardrobe without having to buy complete new outfits. That’s the key to seasonal outfit transitions on a college budget.

        <h2>Fashion face-off: is cow print the new cheetah print?</h2>
        <img src="media/cheetah.jpg" alt="cheetah print picture" class="cheetah">
        <p>
            One of the controversial things to have come out of quarantine over the past year is whether or not cow print is a trend that will live on or turn into an arguably basic and tacky print that nobody wants to see again. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I really don’t know where the trend came from or who started to incorporate it into their fashion but it found its way to the table and has stuck around since. However, there is debate about how long lasting this trend truly is and everyone’s real opinions towards it. As of now, almost every affordable and trendy brand has jumped on the bandwagon of cow print and have released several pieces that use the print, from accessories to clothing pieces and jewelry. Some of the most popular brands such as Shein have incorporated the print into every item of clothing that you can imagine. But don’t forget, Shein is one of those hidden horrors where fast and affordable fashion does not meet the sustainability factor that we all strive for.

            So to leave it up to you guys, I’m curious.
