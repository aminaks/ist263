    My name is Amina Shreve. I am currently an Advertising major, with a minor in Information Management and Technology, and I am interested in the field of fashion advertising, web development, and creative direction. Some accomplishments of mine include completing the IB Diploma program and making Deanâ€™s List at SU for 2 semesters. Some skills of mine include leadership, writing, editing, teamwork, and I am certified for Content Marketing (through Hubspot). I am an Indonesian adopted by an American family and have lived in Jakarta, Indonesia from birth to high school graduation. I went to a British International School in Jakarta for 14 years, taking part in the British curriculum including IGCSE and IB Diploma. I also took part in lots of community service while in high school, giving back to local orphanages and slum neighborhoods by volunteering and teaching basic skills of technology. I was also involved in high school clubs and was a Web Content Editor for a student-founded organization educating Indonesians on Indonesian Sign Language. Outside of school and work, I enjoy being present with friends and family as well as pursuing hobbies involving music, entertainment, and sports.
