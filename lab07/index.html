        I am an Indonesian adopted by an American family and have lived in Jakarta, Indonesia from birth to high school graduation. I went to a British International School in Jakarta for 14 years, taking part in the British curriculum including IGCSE and IB Diploma. I also took part in lots of community service while in high school, giving back to local orphanages and slum neighborhoods by volunteering and teaching basic skills of technology. I was also involved in high school clubs and was a Web Content Editor for a student-founded organization educating Indonesians on Indonesian Sign Language.
